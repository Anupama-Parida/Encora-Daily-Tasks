This is a practice project where I created a product catalogue page using HTML and CSS.
The page displays multiple products with their names, descriptions, and prices in a clean,
organized layout. The project helped me practice designing grid layouts,
styling content, and organizing information in a visually appealing manner for practice purposes.
